# 0x03. Log Parsing
<h2>Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:</h2>

<strong>Input format:</strong><br/>
[IP Address] - [date] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" [status code] [file size]<br/>
(if the format is not this one, the line must be skipped)<br/><br/>

After every 10 lines and/or a keyboard interruption (CTRL + C), print these statistics from the beginning:
- <strong>Total file size:</strong> File size: [total size]<br/>
- where [total size] is the sum of all previous [file size] (see input format above)<br/>
- Number of lines by status code:
  * possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500
  * if a status code doesn’t appear or is not an integer, don’t print anything for this status code
  * format: [status code]: [number]
  * status codes should be printed in ascending order
